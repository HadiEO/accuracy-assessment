## Accuracy assessment design and analysis tool: SEPAL version

The application functions with R, Rstudio and the Shiny package.

In a first step, the aa_design takes a geospatial map (raster or vector format) as input and outputs a file to perform validation on.

In a second step, the validation results are used by the aa_analysis to produce confusion matrix, compute accuracies, correct biases for area estimates and compute confidence intervals


## Configuration

Runs as a processing MODULE in sepal.io

## Tests

Launch the application by clicking the aa_design or aa_analysis button
